# Face Image Detection with OpenCV and Face Recognition

# Face Image Detection using OpenCV and Face Recognition

## Project Overview
This Python-based face recognition application uses **OpenCV** and **face_recognition** libraries to detect and recognize faces in images. The application allows users to upload images dynamically and compare them with a preloaded database of known faces. It provides visual feedback by displaying bounding boxes around detected faces and showing side-by-side comparisons of the uploaded and matched images.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images and draws bounding boxes around them.
- **Face Recognition**: Compares uploaded face images with known faces in a database.
- **Dynamic Uploads**: Allows users to upload images during runtime for real-time comparison.
- **Visualization**: Displays the uploaded image with bounding boxes and side-by-side comparisons with matched images.
- **Interactive Interface**: Prompts for image uploads and displays the match status.

## Libraries Used
- **OpenCV**: For reading, resizing, and displaying images.
- **face_recognition**: For face detection, encoding, and comparison.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multi-face detection and recognition.
- Integrate real-time video face recognition.
- Develop a GUI for easier interaction.
